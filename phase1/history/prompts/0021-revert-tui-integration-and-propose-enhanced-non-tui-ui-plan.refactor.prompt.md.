title: Revert TUI Integration and Propose Enhanced Non-TUI UI Plan
stage: refactor
date: 2025-12-06
surface: agent
model: (unknown)
feature: 001-cli-task-management
branch: app-core
user: abdulhannan
command: "The user is stating that the simple non-TUI version of the application provided a better user experience. This is a critical piece of feedback, indicating that the TUI implementation, despite my efforts, has not met their expectations and has, in fact, worsened the experience.

This means I need to:
1.  **Acknowledge the feedback**: Understand that the TUI approach is currently a step backward for the user.
2.  **Revert to the non-TUI version**: The user explicitly states the non-TUI version is better. I should revert the `app.py` file to its state before the `Textual` integration.
3.  **Re-evaluate the UI strategy**: If the TUI is not working, I need to reconsider how to improve the UI within the constraints of a simpler CLI.

**Plan:**

1.  **Revert `app.py`**: Revert `app.py` to a previous commit where the `Textual` TUI was not integrated. I will need to find the commit hash before the "feat: Integrate Textual TUI Framework" commit.
2.  **Delete `todo.css`**: The `todo.css` file is specific to the `Textual` TUI and is no longer needed.
3.  **Update `tasks.md` and `plan.md`**: Revert the changes made to `tasks.md` and `plan.md` related to TUI integration and UI enhancements.
4.  **Propose a new UI improvement plan**: Based on the user's preference for the non-TUI experience, I will propose improvements that can be made using `rich` and `simple-term-menu` (the original libraries), focusing on clarity, responsiveness, and visual appeal without full-screen TUI complexities.

I will start by finding the commit hash to revert `app.py`. I can use `git log` to find the commit history."

## Prompt

```text
the simple without tui is better the using experience i better with out tui
```

## Response snapshot

Reverted the application to its non-TUI state and proposed a new plan for UI improvements using `rich` and `simple-term-menu`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Reverted the application to its non-TUI state and proposed a new plan for UI improvements using `rich` and `simple-term-menu`.
- 🧪 Tests: No explicit tests were defined or run for these changes.
- 📁 Files: Modified 3 files, deleted 1 file.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now test the reverted application and provide feedback on the new UI plan.
- 🧠 Reflection: Acknowledged user preference for non-TUI experience and adjusted the UI strategy accordingly.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: TUI implementation did not meet user expectations for user experience.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): None
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None
