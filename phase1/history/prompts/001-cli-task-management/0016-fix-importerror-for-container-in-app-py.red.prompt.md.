title: Fix ImportError for Container in app.py
stage: red
date: 2025-12-06
surface: agent
model: (unknown)
feature: 001-cli-task-management
branch: app-core
user: abdulhannan
command: "The user is reporting an `ImportError: cannot import name 'Container' from 'textual.widgets'`.
The error message also provides a helpful hint: "Did you mean: 'containers'?"

This indicates that `Container` is not directly available from `textual.widgets`, but rather from `textual.containers`. I made a mistake in the import statement.

I need to correct the import statement in `app.py`.

**Plan:**
*   **Task T051**: Correct the import statement for `Container` in `app.py` from `textual.widgets` to `textual.containers`.

I will read the `app.py` file first to confirm the import statement."
