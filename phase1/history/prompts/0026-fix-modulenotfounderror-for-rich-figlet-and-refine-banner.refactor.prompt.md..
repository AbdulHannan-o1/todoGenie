title: Fix ModuleNotFoundError for rich.figlet and refine banner
stage: refactor
date: 2025-12-06
surface: agent
model: (unknown)
feature: 001-cli-task-management
branch: app-core
user: abdulhannan
command: "The user is reporting a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rich.figlet'`.
This error occurs because I added `from rich.figlet import Figlet` to `app.py`, but the `rich.figlet` module is not available in the installed `rich` package.

This indicates that the `rich` package installed in the user's environment either:
1.  Is an older version that does not include the `figlet` module.
2.  Has a different structure where `Figlet` is not directly under `rich.figlet`.

**Plan:**
1.  **Check `rich` version**: I need to determine the version of `rich` installed in the user's environment.
2.  **Consult `rich` documentation**: Based on the version, I will check the `rich` documentation to see how to use Figlet or an alternative for large text. If `Figlet` is not available, I will need to find another way to make the banner text larger.

I will start by checking the `rich` version."
