title: Implement UI Enhancements (Textual)
stage: green

surface: agent
model: (unknown)
feature: 001-cli-task-management
branch: app-core
user: abdulhannan
command: "The user wants to proceed with the recommended UI improvements. This is great!

I will prioritize the recommendations as discussed:
1.  **Dynamic Status Messages**: Implement a dedicated `Static` widget for status messages.
2.  **Interactive Task List (`DataTable`)**: Replace `TaskListDisplay` with `textual.widgets.DataTable`.
3.  **Custom CSS Styling**: Introduce a basic CSS file for custom styling.

This will involve several steps and modifications to `app.py` and potentially a new CSS file.

**Detailed Plan:**

**Phase 1: Dynamic Status Messages**
*   **Task T055**: Create a new `Static` widget (e.g., `StatusBar`) to display dynamic messages.
*   **Task T056**: Integrate `StatusBar` into `TodoApp`'s layout.
*   **Task T057**: Modify `action_` methods in `TodoApp` and `Screen`s to send messages to `StatusBar` (e.g., "Task added successfully!").

**Phase 2: Interactive Task List (`DataTable`)**
*   **Task T058**: Replace `TaskListDisplay` with `textual.widgets.DataTable`.
*   **Task T059**: Adapt `update_tasks` logic to populate the `DataTable`.
*   **Task T060**: Implement row selection in `DataTable` (if feasible and desired for future features).

**Phase 3: Custom CSS Styling**
*   **Task T061**: Create a `todo.css` file with basic styling for the banner, task list, and input screens.
*   **Task T062**: Link `todo.css` to `TodoApp`.

I will start by updating `tasks.md` with these new tasks."
