title: Revert Menu Display, Enlarge Banner, and Provide UI Recommendations

command: "The user wants to revert the explicit menu display, preferring the key-binding approach (`a` for add, `l` for list), but wants to improve the overall UI, specifically mentioning the "boring" interface and the "too small" "TODOGENIE" banner. They are also asking for recommendations to make the app "interesting".

This indicates a shift in focus from pure functionality to aesthetics and user experience within the TUI.

**Current State Analysis:**
*   **Menu Display**: I added an explicit `Static` widget to display the menu options. The user prefers the implicit key-binding approach, which means the `Footer` widget should be sufficient for displaying available actions.
*   **"Boring" Interface**: This is subjective but points to a lack of visual appeal, layout, and potentially dynamic elements.
*   **"TODOGENIE" Banner too small**: The `Panel` containing the banner currently uses `width=self.app.console.width`. This makes it span the full width, but the text size itself is determined by the `Text` object's content and styling.
*   **Recommendations for "Interesting"**: This is an open-ended request for UI/UX improvements.

**Plan:**

**Phase 1: Revert Menu Display and Fix Banner Size**

1.  **Revert Menu Display**:
    *   Remove the `Static` widget that explicitly lists the menu options from `TodoApp`'s `compose` method.
    *   Ensure the `Footer` widget is still yielded, as it will display the key bindings.
2.  **Increase Banner Size**:
    *   Modify the `TodoBanner`'s `render` method. Instead of relying solely on `Text` for size, I can use `rich.text.Text` with a larger font size (if `rich` supports it directly, or by adding more padding/lines). A more robust approach might be to use `textual.widgets.Label` with CSS for font size, or simply add more vertical padding to the `Panel`. Let's try adding more vertical padding to the `Panel` and potentially using `rich.align.Align` to center it.

**Phase 2: Recommendations for "Interesting" App**

This will involve suggesting `Textual`-specific features and design patterns to enhance the UI.

1.  **Dynamic Content**:
    *   **Live Task Updates**: The `TaskListDisplay` already updates, but perhaps more visual feedback on changes (e.g., a brief highlight on a newly added/completed task).
    *   **Status Bar**: A dedicated status bar (e.g., in the `Footer`) to show messages like "Task added successfully!" or "Task deleted."
2.  **Layout and Structure**:
    *   **Sidebar for Menu**: Instead of just the `Footer`, a dedicated `Sidebar` (using `textual.containers.Container` or `textual.widgets.Content` with CSS) for the menu, making it more prominent and always visible.
    *   **Split Views**: For more complex interactions, splitting the screen into multiple panes (e.g., tasks on one side, input form on the other).
3.  **Styling and Theming**:
    *   **Custom CSS**: Utilize `Textual`'s CSS capabilities to define custom colors, borders, padding, and fonts for widgets.
    *   **Themes**: Offer light/dark mode toggling.
4.  **Interactive Elements**:
    *   **List View for Tasks**: Instead of a static `Table`, use `textual.widgets.ListView` or `textual.widgets.DataTable` for tasks, allowing selection and direct interaction.
    *   **Input Validation Feedback**: Provide immediate visual feedback for invalid input in forms.
    *   **Progress Indicators**: For longer operations (though not applicable here), show progress.

I will start by implementing Phase 1 (reverting menu display and fixing banner size).

I will read the `app.py` file first."
