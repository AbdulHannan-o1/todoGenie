## Prompt

The user's prompt for `/sp.adr` was the outline of the command itself, but the actual input was the context for the ADRs. I will use the actual context of the ADR creation process.

## Response snapshot

The key assistant output is the creation of 4 ADRs.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Four Architectural Decision Records have been created, documenting key technology choices and their rationale.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Created 4 ADR files.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The ADR creation process successfully documented significant architectural decisions.
