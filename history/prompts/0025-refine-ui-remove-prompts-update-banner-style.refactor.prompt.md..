title: Refine UI: Remove prompts, update banner style
stage: refactor

model: (unknown)
feature: 001-cli-task-management
branch: app-core

command: "The user has provided new feedback:
1.  **"no need to ask user for confirmation on every input"**: This refers to the `Prompt.ask("Press Enter to continue...")` calls I added to mitigate flickering. The user wants these removed.
2.  **"remove the outline arounf the banner"**: This refers to the `Panel` around the "TODOGENIE" banner. The user wants the `Panel` removed.
3.  **"the todogenie text should be in the left side"**: This refers to the justification of the "TODOGENIE" text within the banner. It's currently `justify="center"`. The user wants it `justify="left"`.
4.  **"and bix text"**: This refers to making the "TODOGENIE" text larger.

**Plan:**

1.  **Remove `Prompt.ask("Press Enter to continue...")` calls**: I will remove all instances of `Prompt.ask("Press Enter to continue...")` from `interactive_mode()` and `display_help()`.
2.  **Remove `Panel` from banner**: I will replace the `Panel` around the "TODOGENIE" text with a direct `console.print` of the `Text` object.
3.  **Change banner text justification to left**: I will change `justify="center"` to `justify="left"` for the "TODOGENIE" text.
4.  **Make banner text larger**: I will explore options within `rich.Text` to make the text larger. `rich.Text` doesn't have a direct "size" parameter like HTML. I might need to use a larger font style or a different `rich` construct if available, or simply rely on the terminal's font size. For now, I will try to use a more prominent style.

I will start by reading the `app.py` file."
